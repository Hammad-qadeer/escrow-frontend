## Project Structure and Routes

The project follows a modular structure to organize the codebase. Here's an overview of the main modules and their purpose:

- `app.module.ts`: The root module of the application that defines the main components and services.
- `shared.module.ts`: A shared module that contains reusable components, directives, and services used across the application.
- `dashboard.module.ts`: Module that encapsulates the dashboard feature, including components and services related to the dashboard functionality.
- `admin-management.module.ts`: Module that encapsulates the admin management feature, including components and services for managing admins.
- `transaction-history.module.ts`: Module that encapsulates the transaction history feature, including components and services for displaying transaction records.
- `client-management.module.ts`: Module that encapsulates the client management feature, including components and services for managing clients.
- `api-keys.module.ts`: Module that encapsulates the API keys feature, including components and services for managing API keys.

### Routing

The project uses Angular Router for managing navigation and routing. Here's an overview of the configured routes:

- `/dashboard`: The dashboard page that provides an overview of the application.
- `/admin`: A route that allows managing administrators, their roles, and permissions.
- `/transaction`: A route that displays a list of transaction records.
- `/client`: A route that allows managing clients, their profiles, and settings.
- `/api`: A route that allows managing API keys for accessing external services.
- `/signin`: The signin page for user authentication.
- `/signup`: The signup page for creating a new user account.
- `/forgotpassword`: The forgot password page for recovering a forgotten password.

The routes are defined in the `app-routing.module.ts` file, which is imported and used by the root `app.module.ts` module.

For more information on how to define and configure routes in Angular, refer to the official [Angular Routing documentation](https://angular.io/guide/router).
